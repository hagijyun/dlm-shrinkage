I compare the three cases considered in @HarchaouiLevy-Leduc2010

1. Low noise: $\sigma = 0.05$
2. Medium noise: $\sigma = 0.1$
3. High Noise: $\sigma = 0.5$

These three cases are each sub-sampled to 1,000 points.

The blocks function is included in this project's R package **bsdlm** function `blocks_dj94`:
```{r}
library("bsdlm")
blocks_fxn <- blocks_dj94(seq(0, 1, length.out = 1000))

noise_sd <- c(low = 0.05, medium = 0.1, high = 0.5)
```

The low-noise case:
```{r}
blocks_fxn_low <- blocks_fxn + rnorm(length(blocks_fxn_low), 0, noise_sd["low"])
```
The medium-noise case:
```{r}
blocks_fxn_med <- blocks_fxn + rnorm(length(blocks_fxn_med), 0, noise_sd["medium"])
```
The high-noise case:
```{r}
blocks_fxn_med <- blocks_fxn + rnorm(length(blocks_fxn_med), 0, noise_sd["high"])
```

```{r}

```
