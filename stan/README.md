These stan models use the C pre-processor for macro expansion, and
idea suggested on the Stan-dev mailing list
[here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/stan-dev/PRLzWG6MI58/ikoc21ZCA00J).
The reason I resort to that is that the code for the Kalman filter is
fairly long, has to be altered slightly (different time-varying
components), and I would have to copy and paste it into different
files. 

The makefile compiles ``*.stanpp`` into ``*.stan`` files, which are
then compiled as usual.

The ``includes`` directory includes the stan header files used. And to
complicate things further, the file with the macro
``kalman_seq.stanh`` is itself generated by a template.
