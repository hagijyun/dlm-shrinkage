  abstract = { This paper provides a new Bayesian approach for models with multiple
	change points. The centerpiece of the approach is a formulation of
	the change-point model in terms of a latent discrete state variable
	that indicates the regime from which a particular observation has
	been drawn. This state variable is specified to evolve according
	to a discrete-time discrete-state Markov process with the transition
	probabilities constrained so that the state variable can either stay
	at the current value or jump to the next higher value. This parameterization
	exactly reproduces the change point model. The model is estimated
	by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods using an approach that is based
	on Chib (1996). This methodology is quite valuable since it allows
	for the fitting of more complex change point models than was possible
	before. Methods for the computation of Bayes factors are also developed.
	All the techniques are illustrated using simulated and real data
	sets.},

	at which the probability distribution changes. An approximation to
	the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator
	of the changepoint given the ancillary values of observations adjacent

	equal to a Bayesian posterior distribution for the changepoint. A

  abstract = { Time series subject to parameter shifts of random magnitude and timing
	are commonly modeled with a change-point approach using Chib's algorithm
	to draw the break dates. We outline some advantages of an alternative
	approach in which breaks come through mixture distributions in state
	innovations, and for which the sampler of Gerlach, Carter, and Kohn
	allows reliable and efficient inference. We show how the same sampler
	can be used to model shifts in variance that occur independently
	of shifts in other parameters and how to draw the break dates efficiently
	when regime durations follow a Poisson process. Finally, we introduce
	to the time series literature the concept of adaptive Metropolisâ€“Hastings
	sampling for discrete latent variable models. We develop an easily
	implemented adaptive algorithm that improves on the work of Gerlach
	et al. and promises to significantly reduce computing time in a variety
	of problems including mixture innovation, change-point, regime switching,
	and outlier detection. The efficiency gains on two models for U.S.
	inflation and real interest rates are 257% and 341%. },
