  abstract = {Summary: The fundamental problem of gene selection via cDNA data is
	to identify which genes are differentially expressed across different
	kinds of tissue samples (e.g. normal and cancer). cDNA data contain
	large number of variables (genes) and usually the sample size is
	relatively small so the selection process can be unstable. Therefore,
	models which incorporate sparsity in terms of variables (genes) are
	desirable for this kind of problem. This paper proposes a two-level
	hierarchical Bayesian model for variable selection which assumes
	a prior that favors sparseness. We adopt a Markov chain Monte Carlo
	(MCMC) based computation technique to simulate the parameters from
	the posteriors. The method is applied to leukemia data from a previous
	study and a published dataset on breast cancer.Supplementary information:

  title = {Adaptive Sparseness for Supervised Learning},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {25},
  pages = {1150--1159},
  abstract = {The goal of supervised learning is to infer a functional mapping based
	on a set of training examples. To achieve good generalization, it
	is necessary to control the "complexity" of the learned function.
	In Bayesian approaches, this is done by adopting a prior for the
	parameters of the function being learned. We propose a Bayesian approach
	to supervised learning, which leads to sparse solutions; that is,
	in which irrelevant parameters are automatically set exactly to zero.
	Other ways to obtain sparse classifiers (such as Laplacian priors,
	support vector machines) involve (hyper)parameters which control
	the degree of sparseness of the resulting classifiers; these parameters
	have to be somehow adjusted/estimated from the training data. In
	contrast, our approach does not involve any (hyper)parameters to
	be adjusted or estimated. This is achieved by a hierarchical-Bayes
	interpretation of the Laplacian prior, which is then modified by
	the adoption of a Jeffreys' noninformative hyperprior. Implementation
	is carried out by an expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm. Experiments
	with several benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach
	yields state-of-the-art performance. In particular, our method outperforms
	SVMs and performs competitively with the best alternative techniques,
	although it involves no tuning or adjustment of sparseness-controlling
	hyperparameters.},
