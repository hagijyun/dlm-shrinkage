	at which the probability distribution changes. An approximation to
	the conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator
	of the changepoint given the ancillary values of observations adjacent
	to the estimated changepoint is derived and shown to be numerically
	equal to a Bayesian posterior distribution for the changepoint. A
	hydrological example is given to show that inferences based on the
	conditional distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator can
	differ sharply from inferences based on the marginal distribution},

  abstract = { Time series subject to parameter shifts of random magnitude and timing
	are commonly modeled with a change-point approach using Chib's algorithm
	to draw the break dates. We outline some advantages of an alternative
	approach in which breaks come through mixture distributions in state
	innovations, and for which the sampler of Gerlach, Carter, and Kohn
	allows reliable and efficient inference. We show how the same sampler
	can be used to model shifts in variance that occur independently
	of shifts in other parameters and how to draw the break dates efficiently
	when regime durations follow a Poisson process. Finally, we introduce
	to the time series literature the concept of adaptive Metropolis–Hastings
	sampling for discrete latent variable models. We develop an easily
	implemented adaptive algorithm that improves on the work of Gerlach
	et al. and promises to significantly reduce computing time in a variety
	of problems including mixture innovation, change-point, regime switching,
	and outlier detection. The efficiency gains on two models for U.S.
	inflation and real interest rates are 257% and 341%. },

  abstract = {This paper looks at unobserved components models and examines the
	implied weighting patterns for signal extraction. There are four
	main themes. The first concerns the implications of correlated disturbances
	driving the components, especially those cases in which the correlation
	is perfect. The second is about the way in which ARIMA-based methods
	for trend extraction relate to those based on unobserved components.
	The third explores the impact of heteroscedasticity and irregular
	spacing and shows how setting up models with t-distributed disturbances
	leads to weighting patterns which are robust to outliers and breaks.
	Finally, a comparison is made between implied weighting patterns
	with kernels used in non-parametric trend estimation and equivalent
	kernels used in spline smoothing. It is demonstrated that with irregularly
	spaced data, the weighting used by conventional spline smoothing
	techniques is not the same as that obtained from the time series
	model based approach.},

	identify both the location and the number of discontinuities in a

	spline between jumps, using a modified Bayesian Information Criterion
	statistic as a stopping rule. We explore the method in a large-n,
	unbalanced panel setting with George W. Bush's approval data, a small-n
	time series with median DW-NOMINATE scores for each Congress over
	time, and a series of simulations. We compare the method to several
	extant smoothers, and the method performs favorably in terms of visual
	inspection, residual properties, and event detection. Finally, we
	discuss extensions of the method.},
