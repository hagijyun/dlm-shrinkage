@ARTICLE{CarvalhoPolsonScott2009,
  author = {Carlos M. Carvalho and Nicholas G. Polson and James G. Scott},
  title = {Handling Sparsity via the Horseshoe},
  journaltitle = {Journal of Machine Learning and Research: Workshop and Conference
	Proceedings},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {5},
  pages = {73-80},
  abstract = {This paper presents a general, fully Bayesian framework for sparse
	supervised-learning problems based on the horseshoe prior. The horseshoe
	prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of
	normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches
	for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian
	priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance
	vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness
	at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties
	are justifed theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied
	by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance
	to benchmark alternatives.},

	of the changepoint given the ancillary values of observations adjacent

  abstract = { Time series subject to parameter shifts of random magnitude and timing
	are commonly modeled with a change-point approach using Chib's algorithm
	to draw the break dates. We outline some advantages of an alternative
	approach in which breaks come through mixture distributions in state
	innovations, and for which the sampler of Gerlach, Carter, and Kohn
	allows reliable and efficient inference. We show how the same sampler
	can be used to model shifts in variance that occur independently
	of shifts in other parameters and how to draw the break dates efficiently
	when regime durations follow a Poisson process. Finally, we introduce
	to the time series literature the concept of adaptive Metropolisâ€“Hastings
	sampling for discrete latent variable models. We develop an easily
	implemented adaptive algorithm that improves on the work of Gerlach
	et al. and promises to significantly reduce computing time in a variety
	of problems including mixture innovation, change-point, regime switching,
	and outlier detection. The efficiency gains on two models for U.S.
	inflation and real interest rates are 257% and 341%. },

  abstract = {Many social processes are stable and smooth in general, with discrete
	jumps. We develop a sequential segmentation spline method that can
	identify both the location and the number of discontinuities in a
	series of observations with a time component, while fitting a smooth
	spline between jumps, using a modified Bayesian Information Criterion
	statistic as a stopping rule. We explore the method in a large-n,
	unbalanced panel setting with George W. Bush's approval data, a small-n
	time series with median DW-NOMINATE scores for each Congress over
	time, and a series of simulations. We compare the method to several
	extant smoothers, and the method performs favorably in terms of visual
	inspection, residual properties, and event detection. Finally, we
	discuss extensions of the method.},
