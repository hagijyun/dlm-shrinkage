A flexible Bayesian method for modeling change points, or structural breaks, using shrinkage priors. It applies to breaks in levels, trends, cycles, variances, and regression. I provide Stan code to efficiently estimate dynamic linear models.

I propose modeling change points, or structural breaks, with Bayesian shrinkage priors on first differences in time-varying parameters.
Shrinkage priors, such as the horseshoe, are the Bayesian analog of penalized likelihood procedures, such as the LASSO.
This method has several advantageous features.
First, the number of change points is not specified ex ante.
Second, it is similar to most political science data generating processes, in which the parameter is always changing, but changes are orders of magnitude larger in some periods than others.
Third, It is flexible.
The same method extends to change points in multiple parameters, trends, cycles, linear regression parameters, and variance, among others.
Fourth, for many common models, it is a dynamic linear model (DLM), and can be efficiently estimated with specialized methods.
I implement a set of functions for Kalman filtering and smoothing in Stan, to efficiently estimate DLMs with a partially collapsed Gibbs sampler.
I apply this method to several examples, including public opinion and financial market data.
